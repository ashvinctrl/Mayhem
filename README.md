# AI-Driven Chaos Engineering Platform: Project Mayhem

## Overview

Project Mayhem is an AI-driven chaos engineering platform designed to automatically create and execute chaos experiments in cloud-native environments such as Kubernetes and Docker. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the platform aims to identify hidden weaknesses in systems and enhance their resilience through targeted fault injections and self-remediation strategies.

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Chaos Scenarios**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to analyze incident postmortems and logs, identifying common failure patterns. Reinforcement learning algorithms evolve chaos attacks to uncover vulnerabilities.

- **Adaptive Fault Injection**: The AI dynamically determines where, when, and how to inject faults based on real-time system health and historical failure data. Supported fault types include network, CPU, memory, disk, and latency.

- **Self-Remediation AI Agent**: After executing chaos experiments, the platform employs an AI-based auto-remediation system that learns to fix or mitigate issues autonomously.

- **Continuous Learning**: The AI continuously improves its chaos scenarios and remediation strategies based on the outcomes of previous experiments.

## Tech Stack

- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating microservices.
- **Python/Go**: For the chaos orchestrator.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: For NLP-based log analysis.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for scenario evolution.
- **Grafana / Prometheus**: For real-time monitoring and metrics collection.
- **OpenAI APIs or Local LLMs**: For log understanding.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: For continuous testing and deployment.

## Getting Started
