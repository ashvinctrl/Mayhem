# Architecture Diagram of Project Mayhem

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the AI-Driven Chaos Engineering Platform, Project Mayhem. The architecture is designed to facilitate the automatic design and execution of chaos experiments in cloud-native environments.

## Components

1. **Chaos Orchestrator**
   - Responsible for managing chaos experiments.
   - Contains the `ChaosInjector`, which performs various fault injections.
   - Integrates with the `RemediationAgent` to assess impacts and execute remediation strategies.

2. **AI Models**
   - **NLP Log Analysis**: Analyzes logs to identify failure patterns using natural language processing techniques.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Evolves chaos scenarios based on past experiments and system behavior.
   - **Model Training**: Trains the NLP and RL models to improve their effectiveness over time.

3. **Monitoring**
   - Collects real-time metrics from the system.
   - Sends metrics to Prometheus for monitoring and visualization in Grafana.

4. **Utilities**
   - **Kubernetes Client**: Manages Kubernetes resources, including deploying services and checking their status.
   - **Docker Client**: Handles Docker container operations, such as building images and running containers.

5. **Configuration Files**
   - YAML files for chaos configuration, Kubernetes deployment, and Prometheus settings.

## Workflow

1. **Scenario Generation**: The `ScenarioGenerator` creates chaos scenarios based on AI analysis of past failures.
2. **Chaos Injection**: The `ChaosInjector` executes the generated scenarios by injecting faults into the system.
3. **Monitoring**: Metrics are collected during the chaos experiments and sent to Prometheus.
4. **Remediation**: The `RemediationAgent` assesses the impact of the chaos and applies necessary fixes or mitigations.
5. **Continuous Learning**: The AI models learn from the outcomes of each experiment to improve future chaos scenarios and remediation strategies.
